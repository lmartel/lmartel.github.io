Url Shortener
=============
A simple link shortener hosted at [my personal website](http://s.lpm.io). This was a fun little project, inspired by my realization that [lpm.io](http://lpm.io) is the same length as [bit.ly](http://bit.ly).

The shortening method
---------------------
I wanted the links to be very short but still look random, so they're not really very random. Links are 3 characters, and must include at least one letter and at least one number. They're case insensitive, so you can read them over the phone or something.

TODO
----
- Private links, track with either email auth or password
- Track request referrers
