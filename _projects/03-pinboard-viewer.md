# Pinboard Viewer

Make Pinboard (http://pinboard.in) pins act more like browser bookmarks. Includes fuzzy search by pin title and url.
Click the button or use a keyboard shortcut (suggested: Cmd-Shift-P or Ctrl-Shift-P) to bring up your Pinboard bookmarks. Search for tag names to filter, or search for a page title or URL to find a specific bookmark. 

The results update as you type. Once you've found your bookmark, press Enter or Tab to open it. Hold Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) to open it in a new tab.
