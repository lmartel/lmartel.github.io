TVTracker
=========

My first major, finished(ish) personal project. Pumped!

Usage
-----
* Create an account
* Start tracking existing TV shows--or add your own!
* Read plot summaries and actor lists
* Keep track of which episodes you've watched, and when the next one's airing
* Enjoy some snazzy jQuery

Why I made it
-------------
I got to play around with APIs, somewhat-complex jQuery, and deal with building a 
full rails app from start to finish.

I also actually use this to keep track of all the TV shows I [never have time to] watch
--and I hope that someone else will too. That'd be exciting.

How it works
-------------
TVTracker uses two APIs to gather the information it needs:
* [TVRage] [1] for the episode lists
* [OMDB] [2] for the posters and show-level information like plot summaries
