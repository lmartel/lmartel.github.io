About the Repository
--------------------
This repo has two branches with different stuff in them: 

The *develop* branch has all the code used by compass, foreman, and jekyll to build the site. This is where I actually write my code and content. 

The *master* branch has only the compiled content; it's the "actual" site, and it gets served by github automatically when it's updated.
