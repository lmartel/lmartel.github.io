The second memoir of a 30-year-old British blogger with a drinking problem, Paul Carr's [_The Upgrade_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CI2IUA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005CI2IUA&linkCode=as2&tag=lpmio-20) is exactly what it says on the tin--until it isn't. Facing the grim prospect of his 30th birthday, Carr abandons his London apartment, hawks all its contents for a few hundred pounds and resolves to spend a year living in luxury hotels and having Ridiculous--that's his catchphrase--adventures. It's a "blagger's guide," he says in the intro, to living like a king for $100/night, relying only on some shameless fibbing and "lots and lots of delicious alcohol." Carr delivers impeccably, for a few chapters, on that promise. Did you know that you don't pay local tax on a hotel room if you stay more than a month? Carr does. Have you ever woken up naked in a hotel corridor? Carr has. It's _The Hangover_ for people who own Kindles.

However, even in those first few, Ridiculous chapters the real book peers up through the cracks.
