    Hi there!
%p
    My name's Leo, and this is my website. Welcome! I love what you've done with your hair.

    About me:
%p
    I'm approaching the end of my senior year (that's the fourth one if you're Canadian<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student#Canada" class="citation">[1]</a>) at Stanford University. I'm studying Computer Science with a concentration in Theory. I like to make things with code, teach, sing, and lift weights. The P stands for Patrick.

    About the site:
%p
    Here you can read <a href="/blog">my blog</a> (just in case I ever post anything on it), look at some of my <a href="/projects">programming side projects</a>, check out <a href="/resume">my credentials</a> if you're a recruiter or weird, or just <a href="/contact">say hi</a>. I had a lot of fun building this website, so if you have ideas about more things to put on it I'd love to hear them!
