    Hi there!
%p
    My name's Leo, and this is my website. Welcome! I love what you've done with your hair.

    About me:
%p
    I recently graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, concentrating in Theory. This summer I'll be in New York City at the <a href="//recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. I like to make things with code, teach, sing, and lift weights. The P stands for Patrick.

    About the site:
%p
    Here you can read <a href="/blog">my programming blog</a>, look at some of my <a href="/projects">side projects</a>, check out <a href="/resume">my credentials</a> if you're a recruiter or weird, or just <a href="//leo.pub">say hi</a>. I had a lot of fun building this website, so if you have ideas about more things to put on it I'd love to hear them!
